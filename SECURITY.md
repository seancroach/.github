# My Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I pledge to supply any project with security updates if it is that project's current or previous major release as defined by [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

However, no `0.*.*` version will ever be given security updates if that project's latest major version is greater than zero.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please send an email with the details to <security@seancroach.dev>. This will help me to assess the risk of the vulnerability and start the necessary steps to fixing it.

Thank you for keeping my projects secure.
